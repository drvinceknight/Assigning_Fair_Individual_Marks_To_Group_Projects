Python code to obtain Shapley value of a cooperative game.

The library defines a class: 'Coop_Game' which has a 'shapley' method that returns the Shapley value. The code is currently written so that it only takes monotone cooperative games as valid (this can be easily changed by commenting out correct code in 'characteristic_function_check' function).
